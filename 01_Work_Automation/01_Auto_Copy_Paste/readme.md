# Auto Copy or Auto Move files

## Why i Created this app.

Reason 1 : Copy Files

When am working in Bosch, i have huge amount of data in my laptop.
I need to keep this data to bosch server.
1 sigle file more than 3 GB which take lots of time to copy single file.
Some times it may get error.
So i made simple code that it will copy all file one by one.
anything get error code itself get error.

Reason 2 : Move Files

I have huge amount of files need to segregate by name itself.
For example i have files related to each fuction like (DOC, DPF, SCR, EGR, WHTC).
An engineer is not required to copy paste file.
So made code to filter the files and to move the depending folders.
**Be careful while using move operation. files may get corepted if the destination folder is not available**


& do to privacy issue am not using the same code which i used.
this code can be used as referance or modifiy according to your need.


# How to use the code
